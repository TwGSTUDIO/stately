### Translations

English strings in the Stately app can be found in three files:

* [`res/values/strings.xml`](https://github.com/lloydtorres/stately/blob/master/Stately/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml)
* [`res/values/plurals.xml`](https://github.com/lloydtorres/stately/blob/master/Stately/app/src/main/res/values/plurals.xml)
* [`res/values/arrays.xml`](https://github.com/lloydtorres/stately/blob/master/Stately/app/src/main/res/values/arrays.xml) (lines 4-50 only; rest are from NationStates or licensing)

To translate Stately into another language, fork this repository and create a copy of these files in a new directory called `res/values-[xx]/`, where `[xx]` represents the target language's [ISO 639-1 code](https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) (e.g. `fr` for French and `ja` for Japanese).

For languages with special pluralization rules, refer to the [official Android guide on pluralization](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/string-resource.html#Plurals) for information on how to format `res/values/plurals.xml`.

Commit to your fork and submit a pull request once your translation is ready. I'll reach out and work with you to properly integrate your translation into Stately.

Note that translations only affect in-app strings. Strings from the NationStates gameside (such as issues) will remain in English.
